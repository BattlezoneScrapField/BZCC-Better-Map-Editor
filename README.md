# Better Map Editor for BZCC
This is a collection of QOL enhancements to the stock map editor in Battlezone: Combat Commander. ðŸŽ®
Initially added configs are the latest as of version `2.0.185.0` of BZCC.

### Here's the idea:
- Include new console command buttons into the various menus ðŸ¤–
- Release as a public addon mod on the Steam Workshop ðŸš€
