//////////////////////\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\
Export Terrain Button In Enviroment Session

It does work but it's a little tricky to use, if you move
your mouse pointer near the export button while you have the terrain selected the terrain will deselect , so you have to use the keyboard to activate the switch. To do this simply select the terrain you wish to export then click in the config box , now use your TAB key to cycle down to the export button and press the SPACEBAR to activate. 

or While the terrian is selected type in the console
"editor.environ.export" No quotes
